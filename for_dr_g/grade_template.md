Below is a copy of the table you provided in this file: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M3BUdESUOK9BWpX--DIL2asGGAbP7Z4A9AesqHEi87Y/edit. I will be filling this table out with what I feel I deserve with regards to the grading of this project. The file ```/for_dr_g/concept_map.md``` has the code citations to support these claims.

| Criteria | Points Awarded| Comments |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Student Showed all basic concepts | +20 | I believe I hit all of these targets | 
| Student showed at least 90% of intermediate concepts | +20 | I believe I hit all of these targets as well | 
| Student showed at least 3 advanced topics | +10 | I believe I only hit two 'advanced' topics listed | 
| Student shows a topic not covered in class | +10 | I believe implementing my own custom UI, rather than one made using the Swing UI builder, is a concept that was not covered in class. |
| Student added concepts not listed as shown and discussed in concept map. Student went above and beyond. Work was creative and showed quality effort | +10 | I think that because I made my own GUI, and implemented a genetic algorithm on linkage structures which evolve in real time, that I deserve some points here (maybe not the full 50, but some!).
